# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## MY FIRST REACT APP - Recipe App
## What I used to create this Recipe App
1. First I used the template for React Projects with npm create-react-app.
2. Next I setup folder and delete unnecessary files.
3. My main idea on this App is to use a free API library.
4. For fetching the data from the API I have a little help from a LLM (ChatGPT), but only for some design ideas and to fetch that data.
5. Next for template and styling I used a Dribbble project where I copy only the palette of colors and a little bit of recipe detail page.
6. After I finish the project I deployed it to github, on github-pages.

## REMINDER
!!! I used the free API from https://spoonacular.com/food-api and it supposed to have a limit for requests, so if it's not working I think is from their side.
